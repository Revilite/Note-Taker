To die , to sleep--\nNo more--and by a sleep to say we end \nThe heartache, and the thousand natural shocks \nthat flesh is heir to.  Tis, a consummation \nDevoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--\nTo sleep-perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub, \nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come \nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil, \nmust give us pause.",
